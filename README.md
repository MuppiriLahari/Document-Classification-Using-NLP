# Document-Classification-Using-NLP

This repository contains code and resources for performing document classification using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal of this project is to categorize documents into five different categories: agreements, deeds, human resources, taxes, and evaluations.

# Introduction
Document classification is a common NLP task that involves assigning a category label to a given document. In this project, we focus on categorizing documents into five specific categories: agreements, deeds, human resources, taxes, and evaluations. This classification can have numerous practical applications, such as organizing and retrieving documents more efficiently, aiding in compliance, and facilitating information retrieval.
# Dataset
The datasets used for training and evaluating the document classification model is included in this repository However, you can use your own dataset or obtain a suitable dataset from sources such as legal document repositories, corporate documents, or publicly available datasets.
# Usage
Prepare your dataset: Organize your document data into separate folders for each category (e.g., agreements, deeds, human_resources, taxes, evaluations).

Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the text data by tokenizing, removing stopwords, and converting the text into numerical representations suitable for machine learning models.

Model Training: Train a document classification model using a suitable NLP algorithm, such as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), or a pre-trained language model like BERT.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model's performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Fine-tune the model and hyperparameters if necessary.

Inference: Use the trained model to classify new documents into the specified categories.
